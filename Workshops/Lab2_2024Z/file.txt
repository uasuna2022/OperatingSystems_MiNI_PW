In connection with the matter of the renovation of the Roman Republic Section and the process of delegating Julius Caesar to Gaul,
diplomats have been constantly engaged in correspondence with Rome and logistical planning since the beginning of the war. This note,
as it turns out, immediately referred to the report sent by Tiberius Claudius Nero to the Roman Senate. As it turns out, we must 
prevent further incidents that pose a threat in the event of messengers being captured. To avoid this, it is necessary to ensure a new, 
safe supply of provisions for the Caesar. However, due to the volume of correspondence, we only use single-use, paper tablets.
